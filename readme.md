This is an example of using ajax and jquery to make a simple api call.

When you search for a city the app will send and api call to the open weather app api and return three results 

the first call will get the free version of the current weather and display it in one main card 

the second api call will request the five day forcast and display it in five new cards that are created by adding html with jquery 

the final api call is just for the uv index which is added the the card with todays weather
